      "Start with isometric exercises — gentle contractions where the muscle works without moving the joint. Begin with isometric external rotation: bend your elbow to 90 degrees with a rolled-up towel under your armpit, and gently push outward against your other hand or a wall. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 5 times, 4 times per day. Each week increase the hold time by 10 seconds (up to 40 seconds by week 4). Also do isometric shoulder abduction and internal rotation in the same pattern. Once these become easy, progress to resistance band exercises such as band pull-aparts with elbows at your sides (1 set of 15 reps building to 3 sets of 15).",
      "Begin with isometric exercises — gently push your arm against a wall or your other hand without actually moving the joint. Do these holds for 10–40 seconds, 5 times each, 4 times daily. Also try pendulum swings and assisted shoulder flexion lying on your back with a walking stick. Progress to resistance band external rotation and rowing exercises when isometrics feel easy.",

(2) Standing band external rotation — elbow at 90° pinned at your side, rotate outward against a resistance band. (3) Internal rotation with a band or cable. For compound exercises: rowing movements (squeeze shoulder blades together) and wall press-ups. Perform exercises 2–3 times per week for a minimum of 12 weeks.",

    "question": "What does a proper single leg squat look like, and what are the signs I'm doing it wrong?",
    "ground_truths": [
      "Stand on one leg with the other leg lifted so the hip is flexed to approximately 45° and the non-stance knee flexed to approximately 90°. Hold arms straight out with hands clasped. Squat to approximately 60° of knee flexion. Key signs of poor form: the knee caving inward (medial knee deviation), the pelvis dropping on the non-stance side (Trendelenburg sign), excessive trunk lean, or the low back arching excessively.",
      "The main fault to watch for is your knee visibly tracking inward — medial knee deviation (MKD) — most visible at the bottom of the squat and the start of standing back up. This pattern is related to anterior knee pain and increased ACL injury risk. Keep the middle of your knee in line with your second toe. Also watch for pelvis dropping on the opposite side and trunk lean, which indicate hip stabilizer weakness."

    "question": "How should I progress my single leg exercises if I can't do a full single leg squat yet?",
    "ground_truths": [
      "(1) Hand-assisted single leg squat using a TRX, rings, or sturdy support — hold lightly with two fingers to avoid over-relying on arm support; start above parallel depth. (2) Foot-assisted 'kickstand' single leg squat — keep all weight over the squatting foot but use the other foot lightly on a tennis ball for slight stability. (3) Unassisted single leg squat to a box at parallel — the minimum standard for return to full activity after a knee injury (goal: 10 reps on each side). (4) Elevated single leg squat — squat to an 18-inch box while standing on a 6-inch step, then add external load.",
      "Master basic two-leg squat technique first. Then progress through: (1) TRX-supported single leg squat for learning the pattern. (2) Chair-supported single leg squat — practical for home exercise. (3) Bulgarian split squat — provides support while increasing load on the front leg. (4) Unassisted single leg squat. Supplementary exercises like clamshells, side-lying hip abduction, and band-resisted squats build the hip stabilizer strength needed for single leg work.",
      "During the first 3 weeks, perform the single leg squat with the opposite foot touching the floor for balance. During weeks 3–6, progress to performing with the opposite leg flexed behind at 90°. Aim for 3 sets of 12 repetitions. Perform in front of a mirror to view and correct technique. Progress using RPE — if the exercise feels less than 'somewhat hard' (RPE <4), increase resistance."
