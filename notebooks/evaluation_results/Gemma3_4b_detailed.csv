I've been told I have shoulder impingement. What exercises should I start with at home?,Shoulder - Exercise instructions,Basic,"Okay, based on the documents provided, here’s a starting point for exercises you can do at home for shoulder impingement:

**Important Safety Note:** *Due to the potential for discomfort, start with low pressure (25-50%) and stop immediately if you experience sharp pain.*

**Exercise Recommendations:**

1.  **Isometric Shoulder Internal & External Rotation:**
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 10 repetitions
    *   **Duration:** 10 seconds hold
    *   **Target Muscle Groups:** Rotator cuff muscles (specifically supraspinatus and infraspinatus), upper back.
    *   **How to Perform:** Stand at the corner of a wall with your elbow bent at 90 degrees in front of you, placing a flat hand against the wall. Gently push into the wall at 25-50% pressure, maintaining a 90-degree angle.

2. **Isometric Shoulder External Rotation:** 
    *   **Sets/Reps:** 10 repetitions
    *   **Duration:** 10 seconds hold
    *   **Target Muscle Groups:** Infraspinatus
    *   **How to Perform:** Stand at the corner of a wall with your elbow bent at 90 degrees in front of you, placing a flat hand against the wall. Gently push outwards into the wall at 25-50% pressure, maintaining a 90-degree angle. 

**Recommendation:**

It is crucial to consult with a physical","['Start with isometric exercises — gentle contractions where the muscle works without moving the joint. Begin with isometric external rotation: bend your elbow to 90 degrees with a rolled-up towel under your armpit, and gently push outward against your other hand or a wall. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 5 times, 4 times per day. Each week increase the hold time by 10 seconds (up to 40 seconds by week 4).

Lie on your injured side with a weight in your hand, rotate your arm outward as far as comfortable (90-degree elbow), and control the movement back. Target muscle groups: External rotation (Infraspinatus, Teres Minor). *Safety Warning: Stop immediately if you experience sharp pain.*

3.  **Cable/Band External Rotation:** Perform 3 sets of 10 reps. Keep elbow bent at 90 degrees and rotate your arm outward. Control the return movement. Target muscle groups: External rotation (Infraspinatus, Teres Minor).

"I have a rotator cuff tear — is it safe to exercise, or will it make the tear worse?",Shoulder - Safety and contraindications,Intermediate,"Okay, based on the provided documents, here’s a recommendation:

Given your suspected rotator cuff tear, exercise can be a beneficial part of your recovery, but it’s crucial to proceed cautiously. Studies show exercise is effective in managing these injuries. 

A conservative protocol includes four to six physical therapy visits over 6-12 weeks, with visits every other week to allow for neural adaptation. Initially, start with basic exercises and progress to more challenging ones. A suggested starting exercise is the pendulum exercise: 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, with a slow, controlled range of motion (ROM) of approximately 60-90 degrees. Target muscle groups include the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. 

**Safety Warning:** Monitor your pain levels closely. If you experience sharp or increasing pain, immediately stop and consult a physical therapist. 

It’s important to note that there's no single “ideal” exercise program, and consensus isn’t established. 

**Recommendation:** Given the complexity of rotator cuff injuries, I strongly recommend consulting with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan. Please contact your GP or First Contact Practitioner for a full examination.","[""Exercise is safe and is the first-line recommendation for most rotator cuff tears. Research shows that shoulder activity level is not related to tear progression risks, tears don't always progress in size, and an increase in tear size doesn't necessarily worsen function or symptoms.

**Important Disclaimer:** *I am an AI assistant and cannot provide medical advice. This information is based solely on the documents provided and is for informational purposes only. Please consult with a physical therapist for a personalized treatment plan.*

**Expected Duration & Initial Exercises:**

The prognosis for frozen shoulder varies, with recovery taking months or even years. Initially, aim for gentle range of motion exercises. For example, perform pendulum exercises (10-15 reps, each side) to gently move your arm in a circular motion. 

**Safety Warning:** Avoid forcing movements that cause sharp pain.

**Target Muscle Groups:** The exercises will target the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint, including the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis). 

**Progression & Recommendations:** 

The documents suggest that with consistent, daily exercise, you should expect to feel improvement within two weeks. If you haven’t seen any progress after six weeks, or if your pain is worsening, **it is crucial to consult a physical therapist.** They can provide a tailored treatment plan and address any underlying issues, such as diabetes which may prolong the condition.

I have shoulder impingement — are there certain exercises or movements I should stay away from?,Shoulder - Safety and contraindications,Intermediate,"Based on the provided documents, here’s a recommendation for managing your shoulder impingement:

**Recommendation:**

It’s crucial to consult with a physical therapist for a personalized treatment plan, however, initially, avoid overhead activities and movements that cause pain. Focus on maintaining proper posture and mechanics to reduce stress on the shoulder. 

**Exercises (as guided by a PT):**

*   **Scapular Retractions:** Sets of 3, 10-15 reps – Targets the shoulder blade muscles (scapula) to improve stability and posture.
*   **Shoulder Flexion/Extension:** Sets of 3, 10-15 reps – Range of motion exercises focusing on moving the arm forward and backward within a safe range (consult PT for specific angles).
*   **Core Strengthening:** Sets of 3, 10-15 reps – Engaging your core muscles to support overall stability.

**Safety Warning:** *Listen to your body and stop any exercise that causes sharp pain.*

**Important Note:** Functional training, as directed by a physical therapist, will be key to safely returning to activities. Maintaining proper strength in the shoulder and shoulder-blade muscles is essential, as imbalances can increase the risk of impingement. 

**Disclaimer:** *These recommendations are based solely on the provided documents and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult with a qualified physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and individualized treatment plan.*","[""Current evidence suggests there are no inherently 'bad' exercises for shoulder impingement.

**Important Note:** *I am an AI assistant and cannot provide medical advice. Consulting with a physical therapist is crucial for your specific situation.*

**Initial Exercises (Weeks 0-6):**

1.  **Heel Slides:** Lying on your back, slowly slide your heel towards your buttock, bending your knee. Aim for a gentle stretch. (Targets: Quadriceps, Hamstrings) – Hold for 30-60 seconds, repeat 3-5 times daily.

2.  **Sitting Knee Flexion with Elastic Band:** Sitting with legs straight, place an elastic band around your foot and gently pull it to bend your knee as far as possible. (Targets: Quadriceps) – Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times, 4 times daily.

3.  **Knee Extension Against Bed:** Lying on your back with legs straight, push your knees firmly against the bed. (Targets: Quadriceps) – Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times, 4 times daily.

4.  **Sitting Knee Straightening:** Sitting on a chair, straighten your leg and hold. (Targets: Quadriceps) – Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times, 4 times daily.

When can I go back to playing football after my ACL reconstruction? What do I need to be able to do first?,Knee - Treatment progression,Advanced,"Okay, based on the provided documents, here’s a breakdown of your return to football after ACL reconstruction, keeping it concise and following your rules:

**Recommendation:** Consulting with a physical therapist is crucial for a personalized plan.

**Initial Phase & Criteria:**

*   **Phase 3 (End of Rehabilitation):** Returning to daily activities is likely complete. Diagnostic tests will assess your knee.
*   **90% Strength:** Your injured leg must perform at least 90% as well as your uninjured leg. (Document 2)
*   **Hopping Tests:** Three hopping tests will be utilized to measure side-to-side differences. (Document 2)

**Exercises (Example - Adjust with PT):**

*   **Quad Sets:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps, isometric contraction, targeting the quadriceps.
*   **Hamstring Curls:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps, focusing on hamstring strengthening.
*   **Short Arc Quads:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps, using a padded roll for range of motion targeting the quadriceps (0-90 degrees).

**Important Safety Note:** The documents highlight a significantly increased risk of reinjury with early return to level 1 sports. (Document 2)

**Timeline:** Return to sport typically occurs 6-12 months post-surgery, but can be longer, up to 18-24 months, depending on progress. (Documents 3, ","['Return to pivoting sports typically takes a minimum of 9–12 months post-surgery. Time alone is not sufficient — you must meet specific functional criteria.

"My physio told me to do quad sets after my ACL surgery, but I'm not sure I'm doing them right. How exactly do I do them?",Knee - Exercise form,Basic,"Okay, let’s clarify how to perform quad sets effectively.

First, you’ll perform quad sets on your back or sitting with your legs straight. Focus on contracting the top of your thigh, pushing your knee flat against the surface, and moving your kneecap towards your hip. Aim for 3-4 sets of 30-45 second holds.

To progress, you can do 3 sets of 10-20 repetitions daily, focusing on controlled movements. You can use a towel under your knee for comfort. To increase the range of motion, use a strap and pull up on your foot to add a calf and hamstring stretch. 

A key milestone is achieving straight leg raises without lag. This can be done with 3 sets of 10-20 repetitions daily, aiming for full knee extension. 

**Safety Warning:** Avoid pushing through any pain. If you experience discomfort, stop and consult with a physical therapist. 

The target muscle groups are the quadriceps. 

**Important Note:** It’s crucial to consult with a physical therapist for personalized guidance and to ensure you’re performing these exercises correctly.","['Lie on your back with your knee straight.

I've been told I have osteoarthritis in my knee. What exercises should I be doing to help with the pain and stiffness?,Knee - Exercise instructions,Basic,"Okay, based on the provided documents, here’s a suggested approach for managing your knee osteoarthritis, with a strong recommendation for professional guidance:

**Recommendations:**

Given your knee osteoarthritis, low-impact exercises are highly recommended. Land-based activities like walking, stationary cycling, and aquatic exercise (as detailed in Doc 2) are safe and effective. 

**Suggested Exercises (based on available information):**

*   **Hamstring Curls:** 3 sets of 10-12 reps (targeting thigh muscles).
*   **Quadriceps Sets:** 3 sets of 10-12 reps, holding contraction for 5-10 seconds (targeting quadriceps).
*   **Gentle Range of Motion:** Heel slides (3-5 repetitions) for ROM.

**Important Safety Note:** *Always* prioritize listening to your body and stop immediately if you experience sharp pain.

**Target Muscle Groups:** Quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Taping (as suggested in Doc 3) can provide short-term joint support.
*   Hydrotherapy can be helpful for building strength and reducing stiffness in a non-weight-bearing position.

**Crucially,** it is essential to consult a physical therapist (as emphasized throughout the documents) for an individualized exercise program. They can accurately assess your condition and provide tailored recommendations. *Do not exceed the daily allowance of any medication prescribed to you.*

","['Both strengthening and aerobic exercise are recommended as first-line treatment for knee osteoarthritis. Key exercises include: quad sets (hold 5 seconds), inner range quadriceps with a rolled towel under the knee, straight leg raises, bridging, wall squats or sit-to-stands, standing heel raises, and step-downs (8–12 reps, 3 times a day). Include stretches: quadriceps stretch (hold 30 seconds, repeat 5 times), hamstring stretch, calf stretch. Walking, cycling, swimming, tai chi, and yoga are all beneficial. Start with 2–3 reps and gradually build up.', 'There is no single superior exercise for knee OA. Resistance training, aerobic exercise, aquatic exercise, tai chi, and yoga have all demonstrated improvements in pain and function. Choose activities you enjoy and aim for at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week AND muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days per week. Mild to moderate knee discomfort during exercise is safe and does not indicate damage.', 'Exercise regularly — it helps strengthen muscles around the knee and can help with weight management.

My doctor said I have knee osteoarthritis. Someone suggested PRP injections and knee arthroscopy — are those good options?,Knee - Safety and contraindications,Intermediate,"Based on the provided documents, here’s a summary of PRP and arthroscopy for your knee osteoarthritis:

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend PRP for the treatment of hip or knee osteoarthritis. (Doc 4, 15) The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline suggests against its use. (Doc 4, 16) 

However, some studies (Docs 1, 2, and 3) indicate PRP *may* offer a benefit compared to hyaluronic acid (HA) injections, although the evidence is not definitive and more research is needed. PRP injections typically involve injecting a concentration of your own platelets into the knee joint. 

**Recommended Exercises (based on general OA management):** 

*   **Heel Slides:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps, aiming for full knee extension. (Targets: Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles) 
*   **Short Arc Quads:** 3 sets of 10-15 reps, with a 15-20 degree knee flexion. (Targets: Quadriceps) 

**Safety Warning:** Adverse events, such as swelling and pain, are common following PRP injections and typically resolve within a few days. 

**Important Note:** Given the limited evidence and variability in PRP formulations, it is crucial to consult with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan. (All documents)

"My knee makes grinding and cracking sounds when I bend it, especially doing squats. Does this mean I'm damaging my knee?",Knee - Expected symptoms,Basic,"Okay, let’s address your concerns about the grinding and cracking sounds in your knee, particularly when you perform squats. 

Based on the information provided, it sounds like you may be experiencing crepitus, which is a common finding in osteoarthritis (OA). The document states that this can occur when the bones in your knee rub together due to cartilage wear. 

Here’s what we can do: 

*   **Exercises:** We could start with gentle range-of-motion exercises focusing on straightening and bending your knee (within a comfortable range – aiming for 0-135 degrees) to maintain mobility. We could also incorporate short-arc quadriceps sets – contracting your quad muscle while your knee is slightly bent, holding for 5 seconds.
*   **Target Muscles:** We'd focus on strengthening the quadriceps muscles, hamstrings, and glutes to provide support to the knee joint.
*   **Safety:** Be mindful of pain and stop if you experience any sharp or worsening pain. 

**Important Note:** *While crepitus is common, it’s crucial to rule out other potential causes. It’s essential to consult a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation.* 

Given the potential for underlying issues, I recommend scheduling an appointment with a physical therapist for a thorough assessment and personalized treatment plan. Please contact a physical therapist at 01592 729130.","[""Knee crepitus (grinding, cracking, popping sounds) is very common and is NOT an indication that exercise is dangerous or harmful. A study found that knee crepitus has 'no negative impact on function, physical activity level, and pain.' Crepitus was also present in 33% of people with no knee pain at all. Focus on whether the exercises are causing significant increases in pain or swelling — those are the meaningful signals."", 'Grinding or cracking noises from your knee are common and usually not a sign of damage. Research shows crepitus has no negative impact on function or pain outcomes. Continue exercising as long as pain stays manageable (below 3–5/10). Only stop if there is a sudden increase in pain or significant swelling.']","[{'content': 'to top\nHow Does It Feel?\nKnee OA has a wide range of symptoms. The most common symptom is pain around the knee joint. Knee mobility also may decrease. When knee cartilage wears down, it can expose the underlying bone in certain spots. This causes increased stress on and compression of the remaining cartilage. As cartilage wears down, the bones in your knee joint rub together causing friction that makes your knee hurt and become stiff or swollen. You also may feel grinding or hear popping sounds while bending your knee.\nYour activity level as well as the amount and types of activities you do can impact your symptoms. For example, symptoms may worsen with activities such as walking without supportive shoes or using the stairs.\nSymptoms of knee OA may include:\nMorning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes.\nPain during or after activity.

I've been told I have osteoarthritis in my hip. What exercises can I safely do at home?,Hip - Exercise instructions,Basic,"Okay, based on the provided documents, here’s a home exercise program recommendation for you:

Following a comprehensive management program, including exercise and weight loss, is key to managing your hip osteoarthritis. It’s important to consult with a physical therapist for an individualized program.

**Recommended Exercises:**

1.  **Hip Flexion and Knee Flexion in Lying:** 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions. Lie on your side with your operated leg straight. Slide your heel upwards towards you to bend your knee and hip, returning to the starting position. *Safety Warning:* Do not bend your hip more than 90 degrees initially.

2.  **Hip Abduction:** (Details incomplete – further guidance needed from a physical therapist).

**General Recommendations:**

*   Aim for 3 sets of each exercise daily.
*   Land-based exercises like walking, cycling, Tai Chi, and yoga are encouraged (as noted in Doc 2). Aquatic exercise is also a good option.
*   Focus on strengthening your hip and leg muscles.

Given your symptoms of pain on the outside of your hip, worsening when lying on it, and potentially related to greater trochanteric pain syndrome, it’s important to manage this effectively.

**Recommended Exercises:**

*   **Hip Abduction (Side Leg Raises):** 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, keeping your leg straight and slowly raising it to the side, targeting the gluteal muscles.
*   **Heel Slides:** 3 sets of 10 repetitions, lying on your side with a slight bend in your knee, slide your heel forward and back, gently stretching the hip muscles.

**Important Safety Note:** Avoid activities that significantly increase your pain, particularly lying directly on the affected side.

I've got lateral hip pain / hip bursitis. What positions and movements should I avoid to stop it flaring up?,Hip - Safety and contraindications,Advanced,"Okay, let’s address your lateral hip pain/bursitis. Based on the provided documents, here’s what we should focus on:

**Recommendations & Exercises:**

1.  **Avoidance:** You must avoid hip flexion greater than 90 degrees (sitting on a highchair or slightly reclined) and sitting with your legs crossed. Avoid activities that cause pain.

2.  **Pendulum Leg Swings:** (Document 5) Perform 30 swings, 3 times daily. This helps to gently mobilize the hip joint and reduce stiffness.

3. **Supine Clam Stretch:** (Document 5) Lie on your side with knees bent, feet hip-width apart, and turn the soles of your feet towards each other. Hold the stretch for as long as comfortable.

4.  **Strengthening (Important):** While not directly addressed, strengthening the gluteal muscles (as suggested in Doc 2) is crucial for stability.

**Safety Warning:** Avoid pain and pinching in the hip at all times – any pain indicates you are exceeding your tolerance.

**Target Muscle Groups:** Gluteal muscles, hip abductors, and potentially the greater trochanteric area.

**Important Note:** *These recommendations are based solely on the provided documents. It is crucial that you consult with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and a personalized treatment plan.* They can assess the severity of your condition and provide tailored exercises and advice.","['Avoid positions that increase compressive forces on the gluteal tendons: (1) Avoid sleeping on the painful side — lie on your back with a pillow under knees, or good side with pillow between legs.

I've got lower back pain and I've been told I need to strengthen my core. What exercises are safe for me to start with?,Low back - Exercise instructions,Basic,"Okay, let’s develop a starting exercise plan for your lower back pain, focusing on core strengthening.

Based on the provided documents, it’s important to consult with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized program. However, here’s a starting point:

**Recommended Exercises:**

1.  **Bridging:** (Targets: Glutes, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae) – Perform 1 set of 15 repetitions, gradually increasing to 3 sets of 15 repetitions as you get stronger. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat. Gently tilt your pelvis to flatten your back against the floor, pushing through your heels to raise your bottom up for a few seconds.

2.  **Side Plank:** (Targets: Obliques, Transverse Abdominis, Lateral Core Muscles) – Perform 5 repetitions, holding for 5 seconds, aiming for 5 repetitions. Lie on your side with your forearm on the floor, supporting your weight.

3.  **Bird-Dog:** (Targets: Erector Spinae, Quadratus Lumborum, Glutes) – Perform 5 repetitions, holding each movement for 5 seconds. Start on your hands and knees, then simultaneously extend one arm forward and the opposite leg backward, maintaining a straight line from head to heel.

**Safety Warning:** Stop any exercise that significantly worsens your symptoms.

**Important Note:** These exercises are beneficial for improving core strength and stability. Strengthening the muscles that support your spine can help with pain prevention and functional ability. (Doc 2","['Safe beginner core exercises include: (1) Pelvic tilting — lie on your back with knees bent, exhale as you flatten your back against the floor, hold for a few seconds, repeat 5–10 times, 3 times per day. (2) Bridging — knees bent, feet flat, lift hips; start with 1 set of 15 reps, progress to 3 sets. (3) Lumbar knee rolling — lie on back, knees bent, gently roll knees side to side while tightening abdominals, 60 seconds, 4 times per day. (4) Four-point kneeling bird-dog — on all fours, extend opposite arm and leg. Progress exercises every day for at least 6 weeks to see benefits.', ""Low back pain is not caused by a weak core, and you don't need to brace your core constantly. However, exercises like squats, bridges, planks, and bird-dogs can be helpful components of a rehabilitation programme. Start gently, focus on movements that feel manageable.

My back really hurts. Should I rest in bed or try to stay active? I'm scared that moving will make it worse.,Low back - Safety and treatment approach,Basic,"Okay, let’s address your back pain. Based on the provided documents, it’s crucial to prioritize staying active rather than resting in bed. 

Here’s what I recommend:

**Exercise Plan:**

*   **Start Slow:** Begin with gentle movements, such as short walks for 5-10 minutes.
*   **Range of Motion:** Perform gentle stretches, aiming for a pain-free range of motion. For example, perform pelvic tilts (lying on your back, gently tilting your pelvis up and down) – 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
*   **Core Engagement:** Try gentle abdominal contractions – 3 sets of 10 repetitions, holding for 5 seconds.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Safety Warning:** Cauda Equina Syndrome is a serious condition, so if you experience numbness or weakness in your legs, bowel or bladder changes, seek immediate medical attention.
*   **Muscle Groups Targeted:** These exercises primarily target your core and lower back muscles.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Stay Active:** As highlighted in all documents, staying active is key to recovery, avoiding stiffness and weakness. Limit rest to 1-2 days maximum.
*   **Medication:** Take prescribed pain relief as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.
*   **Consult a Physical Therapist:** *It is important to consult a physical therapist for a personalized assessment and treatment plan.* They can provide tailored exercises and guidance to ensure safe and effective recovery.

I've had back pain for a few weeks now. When should I be worried that something serious is going on?,Low back - Safety and red flags,Advanced,"Okay, here’s a response based solely on the provided documents:

Given your low back pain lasting a few weeks, it’s wise to take it seriously. While most cases are “non-specific” and improve within weeks, certain symptoms warrant immediate attention.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Exercise:** Gentle movements like pelvic tilts (10 reps) and knee-to-chest stretches (hold for 30 seconds, 3 times) can help maintain mobility.
*   **Safety Warning:** Avoid prolonged bed rest as this can hinder recovery.

**When to Seek Immediate Attention:**

*   Loss of bowel or bladder control
*   Numbness in the groin or inner thigh – this could indicate Cauda Equina Syndrome, a serious condition.

**Concerning Signs Requiring Further Evaluation:**

*   Pain that doesn’t improve after 2-4 weeks of treatment.
*   Severe stiffness in the morning lasting over 1 hour.
*   Changes in your spine (shape, lumps).

**Important Note:** These documents suggest that low back pain can be complex, influenced by factors like general health and lifestyle. 

**Recommendation:** Consult a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan. They can accurately assess your condition and rule out serious underlying causes.","['Most low back pain does not have a serious underlying cause. Seek urgent medical attention for: loss of bladder or bowel control, numbness in the area around your genitals or buttocks (saddle anaesthesia), progressive weakness in your legs, or severe worsening pain that is unrelenting (especially night pain).

What is the 'traffic light' system my physio keeps talking about for managing pain during exercise?,General - Pain monitoring,Intermediate,"Based on the provided documents, your physical therapist is utilizing a “traffic light” system to manage pain during exercise. Here’s a breakdown:

The system categorizes pain levels using color codes: green, amber, and red. The goal is to stay in the green or amber boxes, indicating minimal to no pain increase. If pain enters the red zone (indicating significant pain), the exercises should be modified by reducing movement, repetitions, or speed. 

**Recommended Exercises (based on available information):** 

*   **Quad Sets:** 3 sets of 30 seconds, aiming for a 0-10 pain scale.
*   **Hip Strength Testing:** Utilizing hand-held dynamometer, monitor pain.
*   **Dynamic Assessments:** Includes jumping, hopping, and squatting mechanics (rate pain 0-10). 

**Safety Warning:** Pain should return to baseline within one hour. If flares in pain occur for more than 2 hours, stretch more gently next time. 

**Target Muscle Groups:** Quadriceps, Hip muscles.

**Recommendation:** It is crucial to consult with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation and individualized exercise program.","[""The traffic light system divides the 0–10 pain scale into three zones: GREEN (0–3/10) means safe to continue — mild discomfort should settle quickly, and you can progress. AMBER (4–5/10) means proceed with caution — continue at the same level but don't increase load; if pain doesn't settle after exercise or you feel worse the next day, adjust. RED (7–10/10) means stop or regress — reduce weight, sets, reps, or range of motion."", 'The system works by monitoring three time points: DURING exercise, LATER that day, and the next MORNING. GREEN = no increase in symptoms the next morning, so you can do the same or more. AMBER = some increase but able to move normally within 1 hour and back to normal within 24 hours — proceed with caution and try again after 48 hours. RED = big increase that does not settle within 24 hours — rest 48 hours, then go easier.']","[{'content': 'ons are made  \nrelating exercises to an appropriate  level of local tissue irritability  for introduction .   \n \nThe goal for all exercises is 3x30 seconds with minimal to no increase in pain during exercise.

"What does a proper single leg squat look like, and what are the signs I'm doing it wrong?",General - Exercise form and assessment,Intermediate,"Okay, here’s a response based solely on the provided documents:

A proper single leg squat involves squatting to an 18-inch box while standing on a 6-inch step, focusing on quality movement. Perform 10 repetitions on each leg before returning to full activity. The target muscle groups are the glutes and quadriceps. 

During the squat, maintain knee tracking over your foot to avoid instability. *Safety Warning:* Avoid bouncing at the bottom of the squat, as this can increase the risk of injury. If you lose balance, stop immediately. 

The “Supported Single Leg Squat” exercise involves starting in a standing position with hands holding onto a sturdy surface for balance, performing a skater squat, and returning to the starting position. This helps to activate the glutes and quadriceps. 

It is recommended consulting a physical therapist for a personalized assessment and progression plan.","['Stand on one leg with the other leg lifted so the hip is flexed to approximately 45° and the non-stance knee flexed to approximately 90°. Hold arms straight out with hands clasped. Squat to approximately 60° of knee flexion. Key signs of poor form: the knee caving inward (medial knee deviation), the pelvis dropping on the non-stance side (Trendelenburg sign), excessive trunk lean, or the low back arching excessively.', 'The main fault to watch for is your knee visibly tracking inward — medial knee deviation (MKD) — most visible at the bottom of the squat and the start of standing back up. This pattern is related to anterior knee pain and increased ACL injury risk. Keep the middle of your knee in line with your second toe. Also watch for pelvis dropping on the opposite side and trunk lean, which indicate hip stabilizer weakness.']","[{'content': 'at the client can’t push too hard through the assisting foot.

How should I progress my single leg exercises if I can't do a full single leg squat yet?,General - Exercise progression,Intermediate,"Okay, based on the provided documents, here’s a progression plan for your single leg exercises:

**Recommendation:** It’s crucial to consult with a physical therapist for a personalized plan.

**Starting Point:** Begin with the “Supported Single Leg Squat” exercise as outlined in Doc 2.

**Exercise Progression:**

1.  **Supported Single Leg Squat:** Perform 3 sets of 8-10 reps, aiming for an 18-inch box squat. Target muscle groups: Glutes, Quadriceps, Core.
2.  **Progress to 1/3 Single Leg Squats:** (Doc 4) Progress to using hand weights or tubing for extra resistance. Perform 6 sets with 1 minute rest between sets, aiming for a depth of approximately 1/3 of a single leg squat (90 degrees).
3.  **Mini Squats:** (Doc 5) Perform 1-3 times daily, 5-10 reps for 2-3 sets.

**Safety Warning:** Avoid pushing through pain – if you feel excessive strain, stop immediately.

**Important Note:** Prioritize quality of movement over quantity. Focus on actively engaging your muscles as described in Doc 2.","[""(1) Hand-assisted single leg squat using a TRX, rings, or sturdy support — hold lightly with two fingers to avoid over-relying on arm support; start above parallel depth. (2) Foot-assisted 'kickstand' single leg squat — keep all weight over the squatting foot but use the other foot lightly on a tennis ball for slight stability. (3) Unassisted single leg squat to a box at parallel — the minimum standard for return to full activity after a knee injury (goal: 10 reps on each side). (4) Elevated single leg squat — squat to an 18-inch box while standing on a 6-inch step, then add external load."", 'Master basic two-leg squat technique first. Then progress through: (1) TRX-supported single leg squat for learning the pattern. (2) Chair-supported single leg squat — practical for home exercise. (3) Bulgarian split squat — provides support while increasing load on the front leg. (4) Unassisted single leg squat. Supplementary exercises like clamshells, side-lying hip abduction, and band-resisted squats build the hip stabilizer strength needed for single leg work.', ""During the first 3 weeks, perform the single leg squat with the opposite foot touching the floor for balance. During weeks 3–6, progress to performing with the opposite leg flexed behind at 90°. Aim for 3 sets of 12 repetitions. Perform in front of a mirror to view and correct technique. Progress using RPE — if the exercise feels less than 'somewhat hard' (RPE <4), increase resistance.""]","[{'content': 'at the client can’t push too hard through the assisting foot.
